I'm an Mtech research student in Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderbad (IITH), Telangana, India. I'm very interested in research and engineering because I beleive in precise knowledge, precision requires detailed analysis and analysis requires research. My research interests include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer vision and NLP. During my tenure as student and research assistant in IIT Hyderabad, I've worked on many projects which cover the breadth of my above mentioned research interests.
